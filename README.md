# In email-scrape, you will find code intended to extract emails from PDFs created via CoStar's "Report" Function, specifically a company contact report
# This will allow emails to easily be transferred into an excel database, instead of manually copying them from the PDF one at a time

# In database-combine, you will find code that facilitates the speed at which databases downloaded from CoStar's "Export" function can be combined together
# This will allow a database to take shape when you use functions in Excel to match emails with names
